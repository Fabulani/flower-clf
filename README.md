# flower-clf
Flower classification using CNNs.

The aim of this exercise is to code a CNN that provides good results on a classification task. The idea is to test different tools and to measure their impact on the provided dataset.

All code can be found inside `flower-classification.ipynb`. Data used is a subset of popular flower datasets.

This project was developed as an exercise for my Deep Learning class in my master program IMLEX, at Jean Monnet University.

# Dataset

This dataset is constituted by 10 categories of flowers.

It contains 800 color images: 600 (60 per category) are in the training set and 200 (20 per category)
in the validation set. The train/validation split is provided.

The images have different sizes, so it is required to resize them to 128x128.
